The main motivation for this new type of modulator is the requirements of a long pulse facility and the ultra-high beam power of the ESS linac.

Photovoltaic panels, with even the best technology, collect a minor fraction of the solar energy available. The energy payback time for a photovoltaic panel is the ratio between the energy required to produce a panel to the average rate of electrical energy gathered. For standard photovoltaic technology, the energy payback time can stretch to over one-half of a decade. With the rapid change of solar technology, many photovoltaic fields become obsolete even before they cross the energy break-even point. In addition, most solar panels are produced in countries where environmental laws are much less strict than in environmentally conscious Sweden.";
		var solarHeat = "solarHeat";
		var solarHeatText = "Because a large fraction of solar energy is heat, the easiest way to utilize solar energy is to collect heat. This is in stark contrast to the vision of high-tech photovoltaic solar fields stretching across hot and sunny places like the American south-west or the Sahara desert where the thermal energy is an unwanted by-product. However, many highly populated industrialized areas are located in northern climates where heating is essential for a good fraction of the year. The potential for solar heat energy in southern Sweden during the heating months between October through March is 1500 MW-hr per hectare which equals the photovoltaic (electrical) solar energy collected over the entire year.  If large scale, long term, thermal energy storage that is being contemplated for southern Sweden becomes a reality, than the amount of heat collected would increase by well over a factor of four! The energy payback could drop by a factor of two to five if thermal heat is exploited.";

		var hybridWorldText = "While the amount of thermal heat collected from a solar panel dwarfs the amount of electrical energy, it must be remembered that electrical energy is more versatile than thermal energy. The holy grail of solar energy in the industrialized northern climates could be the combination of photovoltaic and thermal technology. The concept of &#34;hybrid&#34; solar panels is not new, but hybrid technology adds additional requirements of water pumps, piping, and valves, and heat exchangers.  This bulky technology might be daunting and out of reach for the average homeowner, especially in low income areas. In addition the question of how hot to operate the panel has to be pondered. The hotter a panel operates, the less photovoltaic electricity the panel produces. This drop in efficiency can range anywhere between 15-30% which would be noticeable to a homeowner with a fixed amount of roof area available.";

		var districtHeatingText = "While the dream of placing solar panels on home rooftops is very attractive to the environmentally conscious and independent minded individual, the field of solar technology is changing rapidly and individuals who invest in solar technology now might lose out in the advances of the future. Also, a large amount of roof area is needed to produce a noticeable dent in a one&#39;s home energy bill."
			+ "<br><br>" + "Sweden, with its long history of collective cooperation, has grasped  the importance of centralizing energy production. In the early 1970&#39;s, Sweden adopted the widespread implementation of district heating systems throughout its municipalities. Advances in renewable technologies and pollution controls can be implemented swiftly and economically with district heating as compared to the enormous cost of upgrading heating systems of many individual homeowners. Hence greenhouse gases have been substantially reduced in Sweden with the centralized implementation of these new technologies."
			+ "<br><br>" + "A district heating system offers a ready-made solution to the drawbacks of distributing solar heat. A large amount of pure &#34;green&#34; heat could be pumped into a town&#39;s district heating system with the connection of a large hybrid solar field. This unique opportunity for  Sweden is unmatched anywhere else in the world.";

Preliminary studies have shown that a hybrid solar field occupying 30 percent of the ESS site could supply enough electric energy to offset the proton beam energy emanating from the world&#34;s most powerful linear accelerator. Collection of thermal energy during the winter months could exceed a daily average of 9 MW-day (200 MW-hr) and a yearly accumulation of 180 GW-hr.
