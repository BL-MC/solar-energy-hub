						<h1>Overview</h1>
						<p>In the summer of 2014, a informal collaboration was formed between Lund Tekniska H&ouml;gskola (LTH) and the European Spallation Source (ESS) Accelerator Division to study the possibility of using solar energy to partially power the ESS linear accelerator. Our preliminary investigations have revealed that the solar energy potential of ESS site is comparable to many of the large scale solar fields found in Germany and other sites in northern Europe. A larger percentage of the ESS site has the potential to be used as a solar field. Because of the availability of municipal district heating systems in southern Sweden near ESS, the capture of thermal heat in addition to electrical energy from a solar field could bring the efficiency of large scale solar installations to a new level.</p>
						<p>By connecting the ESS linear accelerator power converters to a photovoltaic solar field that occupies about one-third of the ESS site, the field could produce electrical power at a yearly average operational rate exceeding 6 MW. This is more than enough energy to offset the energy supplied to the ESS proton beam emanating from the world&#39;s most powerful linear accelerator. In addition, it might be possible to collect from the solar field a yearly average of 20.7 MW-year of thermal energy at a temperature of 80C. This amount of thermal energy is over five times greater than the amount of heat that is planned to be recycled from the ESS Linac; a cornerstone of the ESS renewable energy policy. Collection of thermal energy during the winter months could exceed a daily average of 8.8 MW-day. This captured heat energy could then be fed directly into the Lund central heating district providing a significant carbon-neutral source of energy for the city of Lund, Sweden. The yearly sum of electrical and thermal energy from this field would exceed 24 MW-years. Since the estimated yearly energy usage of ESS is expected to be less than 20 MW-years, this solar field could produce 20% more energy than ESS consumes.</p>
						<p>Since the ESS project will be built in stages with the first stage to be capable of providing 1.2 MW of beam power, the solar field could also be built in stages that match ESS construction project. A hybrid solar field that occupies less than 12% of the ESS site could provide electrical power at a yearly average operational rate exceeding 2.1 MW which is more than enough to compensate for the entire amount of energy supplied to the beam in Stage 1 by a factor of almost 2. The thermal energy available from a first stage solar field could exceed  7 MW-years which is over six times  the amount of heat planned to be recycled from the ESS linac in the first stage of the ESS project.</p>

					<h1>Conclusions</h1>
					<p>While the concept of hybrid solar panels is not a new idea, the use of hybrid solar panels on a large scale is a central idea of this concept. Small scale hybrid solar installations such as rooftop panels are not as efficient as a large scale installations because of limitations in the site quality such as shadows and orientation and the cost and construction overhead of equipment such as pumps, power converters, etc that is needed to service these installations. </p>
					<p>Solar energy is a rather dilute form of energy and efficiency is the key to the exploitation of this energy. The physical proximity to users in both photovoltaic and thermal energy gathered from a hybrid solar field is exactly what is required for hybrid solar fields. Large scale hybrid installations are only possible in communities that have heavily invested on district heating infrastructure such as many communities found in Sweden. Also many of these communities in Sweden have unusable  or undesirable  land such as old factory sites, rail and shipping yards, dump grounds, etc, near their centers that would be ideal for hybrid solar fields that can directly tie into district heating systems. </p>
					<p>In addition, these fields would be close to industrial manufacturing sites that could readily use the photovoltaic electric energy from the hybrid field if it is rendered in a form that is efficient for industrial use. Another central idea of this concept is adaptation of modern power electronics to render photovoltaic energy into a usable form on a large scale that is in close physical proximity to users.</p>
					<p>The nature of developing hybrid solar fields on a large scale might be daunting to many companies because of the size of the project and the risks involved. Building a prototype field at ESS in collaboration with industrial partners would go a long way to reducing these concerns and mitigating these risks because of the already available land and infrastructure that would be afforded at ESS. In addition, ESS is a scientific facility dedicated to the study of new ideas and should be more accepting of scientific and engineering challenges associated with a project of this size.</p>

					<h1>Future Work</h1>
					<p>A research program with its aim to develop a large scale hybrid solar field can be divided into manageable phases. The first phase would be an engineering study to explore the optimum configuration of a hybrid solar field including the logistics of electrical and thermal distribution. The next phase of the program could be the development of a technology demonstrator that would explore some of challenges into developing a large scale hybrid solar panel technology. A reasonable size for this technology demonstrator would be about 2% or a 15kW field. The next phase would be a prototype hybrid field on the 25% scale (150kW) in which aspects of distribution and load connections could be optimized. Finally, the last stage would be a pre-series demonstration in which a 650kW mini-field would be built.</p>
